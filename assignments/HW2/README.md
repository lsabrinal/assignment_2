Overview: I built a Logistic Regression model with a full ML pipeline in order to predict the likelihood of someone getting a stroke based on variables related to demographic and health.
For my model pipeline, I first cleaned my data. I filled in missing values in the BMI column with median values of the training set, and values in the smoker column with unknown. With my categorical columns such as gender, I utilized one-hot encoding to avoid multicollinearity. I also used the standard scalar package to standarize numeric columns. After moving on I realized this was not enough to set up the data, as I had trouble with columns not aligning between the test and train data, so then I went back to reindex my columns. I also made sure to drop the target column here (stroke) from training, as well as the id column which was giving me issues but was not necessary for the model.
I used a simple logistic regression to see how well it would perform on the data, and used an 80/20 split. I also realized that the stroke variable has a weigh imbalance due to how much of the data was 0, so I made sure to account for this.
